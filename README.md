**Rocketgraph** is a complete Backend. When you create a project on [rocketgraph](https://rocketgraph.io/) you are provided with [Postgres Instance](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Hasura console](https://hasura.io/), Automated backend deployments with Git, and a full blown authentication system built in. It uses the open-source [Hasura Batteries](https://github.com/RocketsGraphQL/hasura-batteries) to power it's authentication service.

# Getting Started

## Trying out Rocketgraph

This guide helps you get started with rocketgraph and setting up your backend in just 15 minutes. In 15 minutes you will be able to create a todos app with db, auth and realtime subscriptions.

### Create account
Your first instance is free for 14 days. No credit card.
So go to [the signup page](https://rocketgraph.io/signup) and create account. Then on the dashboard click new project. Wait for a few seconds for the instance to boot up and load the software.

### Project setup
You can see your hasura console url. There you can manage your database.
Follow this [documentation](https://docs.rocketgraph.io/setup) to get started

### Code setup
For your front-end, you can start with the already provided [examples](https://github.com/RocketsGraphQL/example-setups). Just download and `npm run dev`. Todos is without authentication, auth is with authentication.
